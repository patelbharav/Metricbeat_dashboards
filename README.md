# Metricbeat_dashboards

By default prebuilt dashboards can not be imported into Opensearch because of compatibility issues and breaking changes by elastic in recent version. 

Before importing it into opensearch , it needs to be sanitized. 

These are few of the dashboards which can directly be imported into opensearch.

Kindly refer Metricbeat modules as per following link.
